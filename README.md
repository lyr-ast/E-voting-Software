# Elecshion - School Voting Software

Elecshion is a simple, yet powerful voting application designed for school elections. It allows users to vote for candidates, view results, and manage candidates and positions in a user-friendly interface built using Python's `customtkinter`.

## Features

- **Voting System**: Allows users to vote for candidates running for various positions.
- **Results Display**: View voting results and graphical representation of votes in an easy-to-understand format.
- **Add/Remove Candidates**: Easily manage candidates and election positions through the "Add/Remove" section.
- **CSV Import**: Import candidates and positions from a CSV file, streamlining the process of adding candidates.
- **Dynamic Candidate Profiles**: Each candidate has a profile that includes their name, position, and optionally, an image.
- **Simple User Interface**: Designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind, making it ideal for use in school elections.

## How It Works

### Voting Process
1. **Select Position**: Users can choose the position for which they want to vote, such as President, Secretary, etc.
2. **Choose Candidate**: After selecting a position, candidates running for that position will be displayed.
3. **Submit Vote**: Once a candidate is selected, the user can submit their vote, and the system will record it.

### Managing Candidates and Positions
1. **Add New Candidates**: Admins can add new candidates for a particular position. They can also upload candidate images to make the application more interactive.
2. **Remove Candidates**: Admins can remove candidates or positions dynamically during the election process.
3. **CSV Import**: For easy data management, admins can import a CSV file with the list of candidates and positions.

### Results
Once the voting is closed, the application will display the results for each position. The results include:
- **Vote Count**: Total number of votes for each candidate.
- **Graphical Representation**: Bar charts for a visual representation of voting trends.
